# Pentest Image Tools
- *An automated way to download pentesting tools for your Kali Linux VM using bash scripts*
- *Developed in July 2023*

<br>

## How to Install the Tools
*You can download all of the pentesting tools by simply running the bash scripts in your Kali Linux terminal.*

1. Open a terminal window in Kali Linux.
2. Navigate to the location where you want to clone the github repository. For example, `cd Documents` to clone the repository into your documents folder.
3. Git clone the repository using the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/pkf-od/Pentest-Image-Tools.git```
4. Once you have cloned the repository, run the `setup.sh` script FIRST! This is imperative as it contains the code to 
    - set up a `/home/kali/tools` directory for downloaded tools.
    - set up a `/var/log/pkfod-build` directory for all script logs.
    - set up each of the log directories within `/var/log/pkfod-build`. This includes
        - `/var/log/pkfod-build/tools-logs`
        - `/var/log/pkfod-build/burpsuite-logs`
        - `/var/log/pkfod-build/nessus-logs`
        - `/var/log/pkfod-build/teamviewer-logs`
5. You can then run the other scripts in the order of your choice.

## What Each Script Does

### download_tools.sh
- This script downloads all of the most popular linux tools used to perform internal network pentesting and web application pentesting.
- The following tools are installed:
    - responder, mitm6, impacket, crackmapexec, goddi, VNC, and o365spray

### download_burpsuite.sh
- This script fetches a URL from Port Swigger's downloads page for BurpSuite, containing the download for BurpSuite Professional.
- A `burpsuite.sh` file is downloaded and stored into the `/home/kali/tools/burpsuite-pro` directory.
- The script will also run `burpsuite.sh` for you so that you do not have to manually perform the installation.
- A BurpSuite GUI window will open, allowing you to install BurpSuite Professional.

*More information on how to get started with BurpSuite Professional can be found on [Port Swigger's website](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/download-and-install).*

### download_nessus.sh
- This script fetches a URL from Tenable's downloads page, containing the download for Nessus.
- A `Nessus-10.5.3-ubuntu1404_amd64.deb` file is downloaded and stored into the `/home/kali/tools/nessus/` directory.
- The script will then install the `.deb` file using `dpkg -i` so that you do not have to manually perform the installation.
- Once the Nessus packages are downloaded and installed, the nessusd daemon server will be restarted, and the Nessus application will be launched in Firefox.

*Nessus can be accessed at https://localhost:8834*

### download_teamviewer.sh
- This script fetches a URL from TeamViewer's downloads page, containing the download for TeamViewer Host.
- A `teamviewer-host_15.43.7_amd64.deb` file is downloaded and stored into the `/home/kali/tools/teamviewer` directory.
- The script will then install the `.deb` file using `dpkg -i` so that you do not have to manually perform the installation.
- Once the TeamViewer packages are downloaded and installed, a TeamViewer GUI will appear, asking you to accept their [EULA and DPA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/eula/).

*After doing this, you can then launch TeamViewer from your applications menu, and sign-up for an account / login to your account.*
